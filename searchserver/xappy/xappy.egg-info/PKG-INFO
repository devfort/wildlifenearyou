Description: 
        The "xappy" python module is an easy-to-use interface to the Xapian search
        engine. Xapian provides a low level interface, dealing with terms and
        documents, but not really worrying about where terms come from, or how to build
        searches to match the way in which data has been indexed. In contrast, "xappy"
        allows you to design a field structure, specifying what kind of information is
        held in particular fields, and then uses this field structure to index data
        appropriately, and to build and perform searches.
        
        Xappy is not yet stable - in particular, both the API and database format will
        change in future releases.   If you wish to use it, we recommend that you
        subscribe to the xappy-discuss mailing list (see
        http://groups.google.com/group/xappy-discuss) to keep up-to-date with changes
        to Xappy.
