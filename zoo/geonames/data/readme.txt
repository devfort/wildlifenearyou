For many countries lat/lng are determined with an algorithm that searches the place names in the main geonames database 
using administrative divisions and numerical vicinity of the postal codes as factors in the disambiguation of place names. 
For postal codes and place name for which no corresponding toponym in the main geonames database could be found an average 
lat/lng of 'neighbouring' postal codes is calculated.
Please let us know if you find any errors in the data set. Thanks

Warning: The lat/lng accuracy for Indian Postal Index Number (PIN) is not very high, we have been asked to include the data for India in the dump despite this inaccuracies.
For the UK and Canada we have only the first letters of the full postal codes (for copyright reasons)
