<h1>About this site</h1>

<p class="intro">Hello there, so you're interested in who we are and how this site came to be. Well I hope you're sitting comfortably and we'll tell you....</p>

<p>SITENAME was born out of a passion by it's creators for Zoos and the wonder and awe at the vast amount of amazing creatures there are that inhabit our beloved Planet. Why Zoos? Well Zoos are an accessible, amazing opportunity to learn about a wide range of fascinating creatures and a chance to raise awareness about why we should all care about their future.</p>

<p>We imagined a future where there was a place on the internet that contained all the information in one place about the zoos and allowed us to easily search and find our nearest Zoo that housed monkeys, owls or Narwhals in. These are our favourite creatures, we love them a lot. We then dreamed that the site would be community driven so that we could share our trips to the zoo and hopefully have a good read of other peoples ventures too plus many more wonderous zoo related things.</p>

<p>We conceived and turned this dream into reality and SITENAME was born in just one week whilst staying at Fort Clonque in Alderney with the following incredibly amazingly talented good friends who all made this site possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>James Aylett</li>
<li>Richard Boulton</li>
<li>Natalie Downe</li>
<li>Matt Harris</li>
<li>Chris Lamb</li>
<li>Cindy Li</li>
<li>Niqui Merrett</li>
<li>Mazz Mosley</li>
<li>Ben Phillips</li>
<li>Aaron Sokoloski</li>
<li>Matthew Somerville</li>
<li>Simon Willison</li>
</ul>

<p>We really hope you have as much fun using it as we did building it and that it inspires you to take a fantastic trip to a Zoo, just don't forget to drop by and tell us all about it, we'd love to hear it.</p>
