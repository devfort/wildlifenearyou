<h1>The WildlifeNearYou API</h1>

<p class="intro">The WildlifeNearYou API provides JSON (and JSON-P) access to public data available on the site. The API is currently read-only.</p>

<h2>Rate limits</h2>

<p>Access to the API <strong>without</strong> an API key is rate limited by IP address to 30 hits a minute, with a peak burst of 5 hits in 5 seconds.</p>

<p>The rate limit for access using an API key is higher. {% if request.user.is_anonymous %}<a href="/account/login/?suppress-register=true&amp;next=/api/your-keys/">Sign in</a> to create an API key.{% else %}<a href="/api/your-keys/">Manage your API keys here</a>.{% endif %}</p>

<h2>API requests</h2>

<p>All API requests use HTTP GET to a URL. Most of the API URLs are the same as the public URLs on the site, with the addition of the <samp>api/</samp> prefix at the start of the URL.</p>

<p>The API supports JSON-P: just add <samp>?callback=foo</samp> to the URL.</p>

<h2>API responses</h2>

<p>All API responses are UTF-8 JSON.</p>

<p>The default content type is "application/javascript", to ensure the API can be viewed using a regular web browser. If your request includes application/json in the Accept header, that content type will be returned instead.</p>

<h2>API errors</h2>

<p>All API responses have a top-level key called "ok", which will be <samp>true</samp> if the API response has succeeded and <samp>false</samp> if there was an error. The HTTP status code of the response can also be used to detect errors - 200 means everything was fine, any other code means an error occurred. Rate limit exceeded responses have a 403 status code.</p>

<p>If you are using JSON-P (by providing a <samp>callback</samp> parameter), the HTTP status code will always be 200. The original status code will be available in the "status" key in the response.</p>

<p>Here is an example error:</p>

<pre><samp>{
  "status": 403, 
  "ok": false, 
  "key": "1.2.3.4", 
  "error": {
    "code": "rate-exceeded", 
    "description": "Rate limit exceeded", 
    "detail": "Max burst 3 in 5 seconds"
  }
}</samp></pre>

<h2>API methods</h2>

<h3>/api/&lt;username&gt;/</h3>

<p><samp><a href="/api/simon/">/api/simon/</a></samp>

<p>Example response:</p>

}</samp></pre>
